## Project Description
The scope of the project is to create a tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression (regex) functions by examining each part of the expression and describing what it does. 

### User Story
AS A web development student
I WANT a tutorial explaining a specific regex
SO THAT I can understand the search pattern the regex defines


### Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a regex tutorial:

WHEN I open the tutorial, THEN I see a descriptive title and introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does, and a section about the author with a link to the author’s GitHub profile.

WHEN I click on the links in the table of contents,  THEN I am taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial.

WHEN I read through each section of the tutorial, THEN I find a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does.

WHEN I reach the end of the tutorial, THEN I find a section about the author and a link to the author’s GitHub profile.
